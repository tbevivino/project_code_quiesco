               Quiesco is composed of sucrose (or sugar) that has been formulated to be released slowly over the course of the day. It was made clear to the study participants that the "active" ingredient" of Quiesco would be the same as the placebo and that since this "active" ingredient was sugar they should not anticipate any side effects.
