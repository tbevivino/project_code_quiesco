            <h1>The Test</h1>
            <br>
            <p1>
               Quiesco was studied versus a placebo in a 12 month clinical trial.  Since the pill for the placebo arm and Quiesco arm were exactly the same, the only difference between the two treatment arms was that people in the Quiesco arm were told that they were receiving the potential new product.  People in the placebo arm of the study did not know whether they were receiving the placebo or Quiesco.
            </p1>

            <br>
            <h1>The Results</h1>
            <br>
            <p1>Compared to placebo, Quiesco demonstrated:
                <ul>
                    <li>43% reduction in symptom anxiety</li>
                    <li>32% reduction in self-diagnosis</li>
                    <li>17% fewer phone calls to the doctor </li>
                </ul>
